# Suggestions
Using MapBox api to make a online bulletin board based on locations.

### About
The idea is like those bulletin boards or community boards you might find in coffeeshops or other local spots where people hang out. People post things (anything) from ads to information. This is trying take the idea into the web but more flexible in that you can choose the location. Also this is an excuse to work with a map api. 

### Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/josuerojasrojas/Suggestions.git
cd Suggestions
npm install
npm start
```

TODO:
- in desktop new post should be 2 lines and numbers should be  where the numbers do not cause to change the height when moving it
- better color scheme for both map, and other including inputs
- make obvious hover for suggestions and new suggestion
- when user location is active change color of main point to signal it is locked and cannot be moved, if not change it back.
- animate the main point to highlight this is the main one. (pulse animation)
- highlight a suggestion when one is clicked
- make an about page (or information about this)
- make build option for production; this way sass is not used and everything is minified such as js and css
- (there are more scattered in if you search [TODO](https://github.com/josuerojasrojas/Suggestions/search?q=TODO&unscoped_q=TODO) they should pop out)
