TODO:
- in desktop new post should be 2 lines and numbers should be  where the numbers do not cause to change the height when moving it
- better color scheme for both map, and other including inputs
- get suggestions when new bounds is set (easy peasy)
- make suggestions clickable for both the point in map and sidebar
- make obvious hover for suggestions and new suggestion
- when user location is active change color of main point to signal it is locked and cannot be moved, if not change it back.
- animate the main point to highlight this is the main one. (pulse animation)
